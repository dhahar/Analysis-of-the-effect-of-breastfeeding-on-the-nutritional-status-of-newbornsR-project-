## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the effects of breastfeeding on the nutritional status of newborns, examining the benefits of breastfeeding in comparison to formula feeding. The study also explores the influence of maternal conditions, such as gestational diabetes and high blood pressure, on the newborn's nutritional health. By analyzing metabolites in newborn urine, the study aims to provide insights into the health status of newborns and the potential benefits of breastfeeding.

## Importance and Necessity
Breastfeeding is widely recommended due to its benefits for nutritional, emotional, and physical development in children. However, recent research highlights the importance of mother-infant attachment during breastfeeding for brain development, in addition to the nutritional components of breast milk. Formula feeding, although beneficial in some situations, lacks a comprehensive comparison with breastfeeding in terms of nutritional outcomes.

Additionally, maternal conditions such as **gestational diabetes** and **high blood pressure** have been shown to significantly impact newborn health. These conditions can lead to complications during pregnancy and delivery, including fetal damage and the risk of developing future diseases. Despite the necessity, studies examining the impact of these maternal conditions on newborn nutritional health remain limited.

 # The research in this project aims to:
- Reassess the benefits of breastfeeding on newborn nutrition.
- Analyze differences in newborn nutritional health between breastfeeding and formula feeding.
- Utilize non-invasive methods, such as urine metabolite analysis, to assess newborn health quickly and effectively.

# Summary of Analysis Results
Major Indicators for Nutritional Status
The study identified five key indicators related to sugars and fatty acids as crucial for determining the nutritional status of newborns:

Glucose: A vital monosaccharide, directly linked to energy metabolism and a primary health status indicator.

Fructose: Another essential monosaccharide, also connected to energy metabolism and critical for health monitoring.
Sugar Alcohol: A byproduct of sugar metabolism, indicative of efficient metabolic processes.
 
 Saturated Fatty Acids: Evaluated for their nutritional impact, particularly in contrast to unsaturated fatty acids.

Unsaturated Fatty Acids: Higher levels are considered functionally advantageous in food nutrition and require comparison with saturated fatty acids for influence assessment.

# Data Features
Mother and Newborn Characteristics:

Most maternal and newborn variables showed no significant differences between breastfeeding and formula feeding groups, indicating well-controlled individual variables.

# Timing of Data Collection:

Data were collected on the 1st, 7th, and 14th days postpartum.
Nutritional differences, particularly in sugar-related indicators, were observed between breastfeeding types before lactation started.
Maternal Conditions:

Variables such as gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes were included as covariates due to their potential impact on nutritional status.
However, these variables had limited and unbalanced data, which necessitates cautious interpretation.

# Exclusions:

Thyroid function variables: Excluded due to a very small sample size and limited association with newborn nutrition.
BMI: Excluded because it overlaps with height and weight variables.


# Key Implications
Differences in nutritional status, especially sugar-related indicators, suggest that analysis before and after breastfeeding is necessary to fully assess the impact of lactation type on newborn health.

Maternal conditions such as gestational hypertension and diabetes should be carefully included as covariates in future analyses to better understand their influence.
Given the small dataset and non-normal distribution, the use of nonparametric methods ensures more robust and reliable results.
